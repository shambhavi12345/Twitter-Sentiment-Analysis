# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
Our task is to design a machine learning model to predict the sentiment of tweets. Our goal is to build a model that can  accurately classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral. We need to collect a dataset  of tweets.  Here, we are considering a dataset consisting of LGBTQ tweets.

In this project we use Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
for analysing the sentiments of tweets (LGBTQ).

The following steps are followed for the same: 

1 Importing Necessary Modules and dataset   
2 Data Preprocessing and Visualisation

3 Model Building and Training 

4 Obtaining the classification report and displaying the confusion matrix.
